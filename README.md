#Diabetic retinopathy detection

#Dataset folder contains all the dataset require for this project
 - In every dataset there is a info.txt which will provide you all the information regarding that dataset.

#Main.ipynb is the main file where we have CNN plus Unet code
- we have to edit this file 
- current status : CNN working but Unet is not working 
                   - either the integration part is not done properly or Unet itself is not working.

Frontend & Backend part will be taken care after the model is in working stage
